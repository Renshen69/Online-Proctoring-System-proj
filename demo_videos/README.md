# Demo Videos

This directory is a placeholder for demo videos that can be used as input for the application.

To use a video file instead of the live webcam feed, place your video file (e.g., `sample.mp4`) in this directory and specify the path in the `.env` file or use the `--video` command-line argument.

For example:

```bash
python -m app.dashboard --video demo_videos/sample.mp4
```
