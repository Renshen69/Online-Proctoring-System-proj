## SLIDE 5: Technical Approach - AI/ML Pipeline

### 🧠 AI Processing Pipeline

**Real-Time Analysis (Every Second):**

```
Frame Capture → Face Detection → Multi-Analysis → Scoring → Alert
```

**1. Face Detection (MediaPipe)**
- Detects faces in frame
- Identifies facial landmarks (468 points)
- Checks for multiple faces
- Output: Face present/absent, count

**2. Head Pose Estimation**
- Calculates head rotation angles
- Yaw (left-right): ±30° threshold
- Pitch (up-down): ±20° threshold
- Determines if looking at screen

**3. Gaze Tracking**
- Eye landmark analysis
- Calculates gaze direction
- Tracks sustained off-screen looking
- Duration threshold: 3 seconds

**4. Device Detection (YOLOv8)**
- Object detection for phones, tablets
- Confidence threshold: 70%
- Real-time alerts on detection

**5. Attention Scoring Algorithm**
```python
Base Score = 100
Score -= 30 (if head away)
Score -= 25 (if gaze off-screen > 3s)
Score -= 50 (if device detected)
Score -= 60 (if multiple faces)
Final Score = max(0, min(100, smoothed_score))
```

**6. Violation Detection**
- Mouse out: Document.mouseleave event
- Tab switch: Page Visibility API
- Debounced: 3-second minimum between counts

---

- Frames processed and discarded
- Only metadata stored
- GDPR compliant approach

**5. Database Schema**
```
sessions → students → events
              ↓
           violations
              ↓
           results
```
